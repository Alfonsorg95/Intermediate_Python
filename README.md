# Intermediate Python 
This was a intermediate python course on platzi.

## Comprehensions
In this module i worked with list and dictionries comprehensions

## Lambdas
In this module i worked with anonimous functions and high orden functions (filter, map and reduce)

## Error management
In this module i worked with some diferrent type of errors.
Debugging for logical errors.
Read the traceback to find code errors.
Exeption management (try, exept, raise).
Finally i learnet asserts.

## Final challenge
I made a little Hangman game as final project for this course, its working (in spanish) but i hope to upgrade it later and add new languajes.

Never stop learning ðŸ’š
